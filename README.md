# Exploring the Art of Painting Market: Insights into Styles, Subjects, and Top Artists
 
## Introduction
Painting is a form of visual art that has the unique ability to capture beauty, expression, and meaning in every brush stroke. Every painting is a unique work of art that invites us to understand the world through the artist's perspective, combining color, texture, and composition. Painting is a timeless medium because it can celebrate and inspire life with eternal beauty. So of course, many people are reluctant to own it by buying it from the manufacturer.
In the process of purchasing a painting, we not only become the owners of the work of art but, also guardians of beauty. The decision to buy a painting is a step towards art appreciation, where each painting becomes a dialogue between the viewer and the creativity immortalized on the canvas. So, this has motivated me to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the dynamics of painting sales in the community.

# About Dataset
For this project, the data I used originated from Kaggle which contains information about artists, painting sales, types of paintings, and other information which is divided into eight datasets.

# Data Understanding
There are five datasets that I use to get various information:
1. work → serves as the main dataset for data exploration. The information within this database contains a list of paintings sold to consumers. Apart from that, this database contains the identity code and style of the paintings sold to consumers.
2. subject → is a dataset that contains information about the subject of every painting sold by the artist.
3. museum → it contains information about the museums that are used as locations for selling paintings to consumers. The various types of information in this dataset include museum ID, museum name, address, city, state, and even website links.
4. artist → artist is the third dataset which contains biographical information and life history of the artist who produced the painting.
5. product size → it becomes a dataset that contains the sales history of paintings to consumers across all museum locations. In this dataset there are two painting prices recorded, namely regular price and sale price.

# Problem Statement
Some questions that can be used as references in the analysis are as follows:
1. Analyze total sales of painting products based on style, subject, and artist throughout the world. Apart from that, I also want to know the total income for each type of painting that was successfully sold to consumers.
2. Provide recommendations that can be considered as a strategy to increase painting sales in the future

# Summary for Overall Insight
First of all, this analysis encompasses 23 different art styles and 29 subjects creating artistic diversity with 37 museums in 11 countries and involving 214 artists. This event generated art revenues of $4,971,985 and it is clear that art has an important role and is highly appreciated in society.
Impressionism, Baroque and Rococo art styles are favorite choices with sales of over 1000 units. This shows its high popularity in the market. However, the United States (USA) dominates the art market with total sales reaching 7,487 paintings, while other countries have a lower contribution.
In the category of painting subjects, portraits stand out as the most popular, with sales reaching 2,353 units, followed by still-life and nude. In the artists: Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Vincent Van Gogh play a leading role with their unique works in the art industry.
